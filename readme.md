# API-RUST
Note: Every time you run a prisma command, go to the autogenerated prisma.rs file in src and add #[derive(Clone)] to the struct on top of PrismaClient. This is because the prisma.rs file is autogenerated and will be overwritten every time you run a prisma command and by default does not implement the Clone trait. This is needed for the API to work.

# To run the API
1. Install Rust from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Run the following commands:
``` cargo run --package api-rust --bin api-rust ```


# Tasks
 - [] AT THE END: Recheck all the docs to ensure they are compatible with the new structs
 - [] AT THE END: Check if the app_state is being called in a function incorrectly
 - [] update the return types of all the functions to be extra descriptive
 - [] add auth
 - [] add tests
 - [] add logging
 - [] make all structs camelCase based on https://jsonapi.org/recommendations/#:~:text=Member%20names%20SHOULD%20be%20camel,and%20%E2%80%9C0%2D9%E2%80%9D
 - [] make sure time in chrono(fixedOffset) is compatible with https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime otherwise add converter utility function
 - [] reformat path params to be struct so that we get serde desiarilization and get better parsing errors especially with invalid data types

# Notes about cool axum/web dev stuff that I found out
 - if the path parameter doesn't return the required entity, axum

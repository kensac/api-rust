# API-RUST
Note: Everytime you run a prisma command, go to the autogenerated prisma.rs file in src and add #[derive(Clone)] to the struct on top of PrismaClient. This is because the prisma.rs file is autogenerated and will be overwritten everytime you run a prisma command and by default does not implement the Clone trait. This is needed for the API to work.

# To run the API
1. Install Rust from https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Run the following commands:
``` cargo run --package api-rust --bin api-rust ```
